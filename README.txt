SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR GVC, HMG, AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT SEEMS TO BE COLLUDING TOGETHER
--------------------------

I'm not exactly sure why, but there are like a ton of missing dependencies from this repo.
Now with that out of the way, here's how you set this up and build like *a few* of the projects. You use intellij because eclipse is hot garbage and light theme is for people who are into torture. Now You grab your trusty android SDK (https://developer.android.com/studio ), 1 for this minecraft project for some fucking reason,
path intellij there and boom, error hub but the great thing is at least 1/4th of the mods build the rest are either anime or like uhhh something I really don't even know anymore man I just like guns
Also theres like some vehicle code or something but like I already do that so I am taking the liberty of just ignoring it because it errored out because there were like some missing files or something...
(I might have maybe possibly ran out of storage space, but like that's not real and thats a glowingfederal psyop)

1: (If god hates you I'm using android-studio-2024.1.2.12-windows so go find that version, no im not gonna go find it for you)

GPT TLDR FOR GOLDFISH:

TL;DR:
This repo has tons of missing dependencies, and I have no idea why.

Setup & Build (for some projects):
Use IntelliJ – Eclipse is trash, and light theme is for masochists.
Get the Android SDK – [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio). For some reason, it's needed for this Minecraft project.
Path IntelliJ to the SDK – Expect errors. At least 1/4th of the mods will build.
Ignore broken vehicle code – Missing files, I don’t care.
Storage issues? – Maybe I ran out, but that’s just a glowing federal psyop.
Bonus: If you're cursed, I'm using Android Studio 2024.1.2.12 (Windows)—go find it yourself.


Regular forge install tutorial:


-------------------------------------------
Source installation information for modders
-------------------------------------------
This code follows the Minecraft Forge installation methodology. It will apply
some small patches to the vanilla MCP source code, giving you and it access 
to some of the data and functions you need to build a successful mod.

Note also that the patches are built against "unrenamed" MCP source code (aka
srgnames) - this means that you will not be able to read them directly against
normal code.

Source pack installation information:

Standalone source installation
==============================

To install this source code for development purposes, extract this zip file.
It ships with a demonstration mod. Run 'gradlew setupDevWorkspace' to create
a gradle environment primed with FML. Run 'gradlew eclipse' or 'gradlew idea' to
create an IDE workspace of your choice.
Refer to ForgeGradle for more information about the gradle environment
Note: On macs or linux you run the './gradlew.sh' instead of 'gradlew'

Forge source installation
=========================
MinecraftForge ships with this code and installs it as part of the forge
installation process, no further action is required on your part.

For reference this is version @MAJOR@.@MINOR@.@REV@.@BUILD@ of FML
for Minecraft version @MCVERSION@.
